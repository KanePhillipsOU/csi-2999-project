# CSI 2999 Project
This is a five member group project done for Oakland University's Sophomore Project class. Our team chose to do a campsite reservation website. A working demo can be seen [here](https://csi-2999-project.onrender.com/). Please wait a few minutes after clicking the link for the application to start up. 


## Why Campsite Reservation Software? 
In response to having used ineffective campsite reservation software in the past, our team decided we wanted to form a solution. We decided to make reservation software that was both versatile and modern. To best reach our users, we wanted our UI to be adaptable to both desktop and mobile screens, along with the ability to work on any device with an internet connection. We set out to accomplish this through a full-stack web application that made making campsite reservations quick and headache-free.


## How it Was Made
Our web application utilizes a Java/Spring Boot back-end and an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end. Campsite and reservation data is stored in a remote PostgreSQL database which is accessed through PostgREST, a RESTful API. This allowed us to maintain a secure storage and transfer of customer data. Our template engine of choice was ThymeLeaf, which allowed us to quickly form user-friendly visuals of all campsite information. 
Since our application had to be made in a short seven week time frame, our team used Jira to manage the assignment of tasks to each team member. Scrum methodologies were used to break our project into sprints which aided in keeping us all on track. We are currently on track to complete the project by June 23rd.
